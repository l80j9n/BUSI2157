Question   12
ABC Limited, producing a range of minerals, is organised into two trading groups: one   handles wholesale   business and the other sales   to   retailers.One   of   its   products   is   moulding   clay.      The   wholesale   group   extracts   the   clay   and   sells   it   to   external wholesale customers as well   as to   the   retail   group.      The   production   capacity   is   2,000   tonnes   per   month   but   at   present   sales   are   limited   to   80%   capacity:   1,000   tonnes   wholesale   and 600   tonnes   retail.
The transfer   price was agreed at £200   per tonne   in   line   with the   external   wholesale   trade   price.The   retail   group   produces   100   bags   of   refined   clay from   each tonne   of   moulding   clay   which   it   sells at   £4.00 a   bag.    It   would   sell   a   further   400   tonnes,   if the   retail   trade   price   were   reduced   to   £3.20   a   bag.

Question   13The XYZ   Partnership   operates a deer farm,   selling   high-quality   venison   for   both   domestic   and   export    markets.    Due    to    a   temporary    recession    in    the    market    for    venison,    the   farm    has   surplus   capacity,   which   the   partnership   is   anxious   to   utilise   for   short-term   profit,   if   at   all   possible.   The   Ministry   of   Agriculture   and   Fisheries   has   asked   the   partnership   to   provide   a   quotation   for    use    of   the   farm’s   facilities    and    livestock    in    order    to    undertake    a    one-year experiment   into   the   effect   of   different   feeding   methods.   XYZ   Partnership’s   management   is   keen   to   obtain   this   work,   as   it   appears   to   be   an   ideal   way   of   profitably   using   the   existing   spare capacity.
The following   information   is available:
Alternative feed
This   will   be   supplied   as   required   by   the   Ministry   of   Agriculture   and   Fisheries,   resulting   in   a   saving   in   feed   purchase   costs   to   the   farm   of   £4,000.   However,   the   farm’s   existing   stock   of   feed will   need to   be disposed of at   a   cost   of   £1,600,   since   it   cannot   be   used   during   the   period   of the   experiment,   nor   can   it   be   stored   until   this   is   complete.   Special   feeding   equipment   will   be   supplied   by   the   Ministry   and   the   farm   will   need   to   remove   and   store   its   own   equipment   during the   experiment. This   will   cost   £750   in   total,   but,   whilst   in   storage, the   equipment   can   be   refurbished, thereby saving future costs of   £200.
Labour costs
The    farm    will      not       need    to      employ      any      additional    workers       in    order      to       undertake    the   experiment.   However,   the   more   intensive   feeding   methods   required   by   the   experiment   will   mean   that   work   which   the   employees   concerned   could   otherwise   do   must   be   subcontracted.   If not used on the   experiment, the   workers   concerned   could   either:
1.    Clear   some   scrubland   and   make   it   suitable   for   grazing,   saving   subcontracting   costs   of   £2,000;   or
2.    Undertake   repairs to   some   of the farm’代 写BUSI2157 MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING AUTUMN SEMESTER 2020-2021Processing

Irrespective   of whether their time   is   spent   on the   experiment   or   on   one   of   the   other   projects   above, 300   hours’ work   is   involved. The farmhands concerned are   paid   £4   per   hour.
Other costs
The    Ministry    of    Agriculture    and    Fisheries    will    supply    a    desktop    computer    and    necessary   software   on   which   to   record   the   results   of   the   experiment.   The   farm   manager   will   need   to   attend   a   training   course    in    London    before    he    can      use    this    recording    system;    travel    and   subsistence   costs   incurred   by   XYZ   Partnership   as   a   result   will   be   £2,200.   While   the   farm   manager   is   absent   on   this   training   course,   it   will   be   necessary   to   recall the   chargehand   from   holiday,   for   which   he   will   receive   a   special   payment   of   £400. The   deer   farm’s   fixed   costs   for   the   period   of   the   experiment   are   estimated   at   £28,000   and   will   increase   by   £2,700   due   to   extra administration   if the experiment   is   undertaken.
Quotation
XYZ   Partnership’s   management   reckons   that   a   quotation   of   less   than   £7,000   is   likely   to   be   successful in obtaining   the   work.
Required:
(a)                         Calculate       the       net         relevant         cost         or         net         relevant         benefit         to         XYZ
Partnership   of   a   decision   of   the   lowest   quotation   price   which   is   financially   viable.       (20 marks)
(b)                         State,    and    briefly      explain,    if    any    other    relevant    considerations    which
management should bear in   mind when   making their decision.       (10 marks)
(c)                         Explain   why,   in   relevant   costing,   contribution   theory   is   used   as   a   basis
for   providing information relevant   to decision-making.      (10 marks)（Total   40 marks)
Question   14Division   B   and   Division   C   are   two   divisions   of   a   large,   manufacturing   company.   Whilst   both   divisions    operate    in      almost      identical      markets,      each      division      operates      separately      as      an   investment centre.   Each   month, operating   statements   must   be   prepared   by each division   and   these are   used as a   basis for performance   measurement   for   the   divisions.Last    month,    senior    management    decided    to    recharge    head    office    costs    to    the    divisions.   Consequently, each division   is   now going to   be   required to   deduct a   share   of   head   office   costs   in   its operating statement   before arriving at ‘net   profit’,   which   is   then   used   to   calculate   return   on   investment   (ROI).   Prior to this,   ROI   has   been calculated   using controllable   profit   only. The   company’s   target   ROI,   however,   remains   unchanged   at   20%   per   annum.   For   each   of the   last   three   months,   Divisions   B   and   C   have   maintained   ROIs   of   22%   per   annum   and   23%   per   annum   respectively,   resulting   in   healthy   bonuses   being   awarded   to   staff. The   company   has   a   cost of capital   of   10%.

Required:
(a)          Calculate the   expected   annualised   Return   on   Investment   (ROI)   using   the   new
method   as   preferred   by   senior   management,   based   on   the   above   budgeted   operating statements, for each of the divisions.      (4 marks)
(b)             The    division    managing    directors    are    unhappy    about    the    results      produced      by    your   calculations   in   (a)   and   have   heard that a   performance   measure called ‘residual   income’   may   provide   more   information.
Calculate the   annualised   residual   income   (RI) for   each   of the   divisions,   based   on the net profit figures   for   the   month   of July.       (6 marks)
(c)             Discuss   the   expected   performance   of   each   of   the   two   divisions,   using   both   ROI    and       RI,      and      making    any       additional    calculations       deemed      necessary.   Conclude   as   to   whether,   in   your   opinion,   the   two   divisions   have   performed   well.       (12 marks)
(d)             Division   B   has   now   been   offered   an   immediate   opportunity to   invest   in   new   machinery   at   a   cost   of   £2.12   million. The   machinery   is   expected   to   have   a   useful   economic   life   of   four years, after which   it could   be sold   for   £200,000.   Division   B’s   policy   is   to   depreciate   all   of   its   machinery   on   a   straight-line   basis   over   the   life   of   the   asset.   The   machinery   would   be   expected   to   expand   Division   B’s   production   capacity,   resulting   in   an   8.5%   increase   in contribution   per   month.Recalculate   Division   B’s   expected   annualised   ROI   and   annualised   RI    (using   closing   net   assets value),   based   on July’s   budgeted   operating   statement   after   adjusting for the   investment. State   whether director will   be   making   a   decision   that   is   in   the   best   interests   of   the   company   as   a   whole   if   ROI   is   used   as   the   basis of the decision.                   (10 marks)
(e)          Explain    any      behavioural      problems    that    will      result      if    the    company’s      senior
management    insist    on      using    solely      ROI,      based      on      net      profit      rather      than   controllable profit, to assess divisional performance and   reward   staff.                   (8 marks)(Total 40 marks)
