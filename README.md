Question   1
Company G has a machining facility specializing in work for the aircraft components market. The prior job-costing system had two direct-cost categories (direct materials and direct manufacturing labour) and a single indirect-cost pool (manufacturing overhead, allocated using direct labour-hours). The indirect cost-allocation rate of the prior system for the year would have been £115 per direct manufacturing labour-hour. Recently, a team with members from product design, manufacturing and accounting used an activity-based approach to refine its job-costing system. The two direct-cost categories were retained. The team decided to replace the single indirect-cost pool with five indirect-cost pools. These five cost pools represent five activity areas at the facility, each with its own supervisor and budget responsibility. Pertinent data are as follows:Activity areaCost driver used   as   allocation   baseCost-allocation   rate £Materials   handlingParts0.40Lathe   workTurns0.20MillingMachine-hours20.00GrindingParts0.80TestingUnits tested   (all units   have   to   be   tested)15.00
Information-gathering technology has advanced to the point where all the data necessary for   budgeting in these five activity areas are automatically collected. Two representative jobs processed under the new system at the facility in the most recent period had the following characteristics:
   Job AJob   BDirect   materials cost   per job£9,700£59,900Direct   manufacturing   labour cost   per job£750£11,250Direct   manufacturing   labour-hours   per job25375Parts   per job5002,000Turns   per job20,00060,000Machine-hours   per job1501,050Units   per job10200
Required:
(a)          Calculate the per   unit   manufacturing   costs   of   each job   under the   prior job-   costing system.      (6 marks)
(b)          Calculate the per   unit   manufacturing costs   of   each job   under the   activity-based-costing system.       (14 marks)
(c)          Compare   the   per   unit   cost   figures   for   Jobs   A   and   B   calculated   in   requirements   (a) and   (b).   Explain why the prior and the activity-based   costing systems differ in their job cost estimates for each job? Why   might   these differences   be important to Company   G?       (14 marks)
(d)          Assume the company uses ‘total   cost   plus’   pricing.   Explain   TWO   disadvantages of ‘total cost plus’   pricing.       (6 marks)(Total 40 marks)
Question   2Cars   Ltd,   a   local   garage,   which   has   a   body   shop.   The   body   shop   manager   has   contacted   a   management   accountant,   saying   that   one   of   the   company’s   present   customers   has   offered   the   company a   one-year contract for additional   work.   The   customer   requires   a   discount   of   10   per   cent   to   be   allowed   on   the   total   invoice   value. The   manager   provides   the   accountant   with   the following   information:
1.   Additional capital expenditure will   be:
   £Video conferencing facility10,000Additional storage trolleys5,000Computerised estimated system10,000The   customer   insists   on   installation   of the   video   conferencing   facility   which   will   not   be   usable for any other contract. The   storage   trolleys   and   estimating   system   may   be   used   on other work after the end   of this   particular   contract.
2.   Additional   staff   will   be   required.   Three   full-time   skilled   technicians   earning   £8.00   per   hour   will   each   work   39   hours   per   week   on   the   new   contract.   They   are   each   allowed   6   weeks   per   year   paid   holidays   and   2   weeks   paid   training.   Labour   efficiency   is   95   per   cent   measured   as   the   ratio   of   sold   hours/hours   occupied.   Training   time   and   holiday   time    are    charged    to    direct    costs    of    the    department.    For    each    technician    the    new   contract will   leave some   unsold   hours available for any   other jobs   coming   into the   body   shop. One full-time car cleaner will   be   required   earning   £10,500   per   annum.
3.   The   customer   has   said   that   the   potential   increase   in   sales   due   to   chargeable   hours   from   this   contract   could   be   4,500   hours   at   a   rate   of   £20.00   per   hour   before   discount.   In   addition,   the   increase   in   sales   of   car   parts   is   calculated   on   the   basis   of   £40.00   per   hour with   an   average   gross   profit   of   15   per   cent   before   discount. The   increase   in   paint   sales   is calculated on the   basis of £3.50   per   hour   with   an   average   gross   profit   of 40   per   cent   before discount.
4.   Additional annual overheads will   be as   follows:
   £Variable costs5,500Fixed   costs6,500
5.    Depreciation   is calculated on   a straight-line   basis   as   follows:

The   Notebook   Division   is currently   purchasing   10,000 calculators   per year from an overseas   supplier at a cost   of   £29   per   calculator.
Required:
(a)          Assume that the Calculator   Division   has enough   idle   capacity   to   handle   all
of the   Notebook   Division’s needs. What is the acceptable   range, if   any,   for   the transfer   price between the two divisions?                      (8 marks)
(b)          Assume that the Calculator   Division is   selling   all   of the   calculators   that   it
can   produce to outside customers. What is the acceptable   range,   if any,   for   the transfer   price between the two divisions?                           (8 marks)
(c)          Assume again that   the   Calculator   Division   is   selling   all   of the   calculators      that it can   produce to outside customers. Also assume that   £3   in   variable   expenses can   be avoided. What is the acceptable   range,   if any, for   the   transfer   price between the two divisions?       (8 marks)

Notebook   Division   needs   20,000   special calculators   per year. The   Calculator   Division’s variable costs to manufacture and ship the special   calculator would be £20 per   unit. To   produce these   special   calculators, the   Calculator   Division would have to reduce its   production and   sales   of   regular   calculators from   100,000 units   per year to 70,000 units   per year.   As   far   as         the Calculator   Division is concerned, what is the   lowest   acceptable transfer   price?                (8 marks)

Question   2
RST   manufactures three   products   using different quantities of   the same   resources.   Details of   these   products are as   follows:ProductRST

   7399118Profit172732
The   management of RST   has   predicted the demand for these   products for July   as   follows:
Product R                                                                       500 units
Product S                                                                        800 units
Product T                                                                        1,600 unitsThese demand estimates do   NOT   include   an order from   a   major   customer   to   supply   400   units   per   month of each of the three   products, at a discount   of   £10   per   unit   from   the   market   selling   price.
During July, the   management of RST anticipate that there   will   be   a   shortage   of   material   B,   and that only   17,500   kgs will   be   available.
It   is   not   possible for   RST to   hold   inventory of any   raw   materials, work in   progress   or   finished   products.
Required:
(a)          Prepare calculations to show the optimum product mix to maximise    RST’s
profit for July, assuming that the order with   the   major   customer   is   supplied   in   full.       (10 marks)
RST   has   now   realised that the contract with the   major customer does   not   have   to   be   met   in full for any of the three   products. The customer will accept   whatever   RST   is   prepared   to   supply at the contracted   prices   but they will change   a financial   penalty   if   RST   does   not   supply   them   in full   in   July.
(b)             Calculate   the   lowest   value   of   the   financial   penalty   that   the   major   customer   would   need to   insert   in the   contract to   ensure that   RST   meets   its   order   in   full   in July.      (10 marks)

Now that you   have   presented your answer to   (a)   and   (b)   above   to   the   management   team   of   RST,   the   production   manager   has   advised   that,   due   to   holidays,   the   number   of   direct   labour   hours available will be   reduced to   a total   of   9,800   hours   in   July.A   decision   has   been   made   that   RST   will   fulfil   its   order   with   the   major   customer   in   full   in   July   and   it   has   been   agreed   that   a   linear   programming   model   will   be   used   to   determine   optimum   usage   of the   resources   that   will   be   available   after   setting   aside   those   required   for   the   major   customer’s order.
(c)          Identify the objective function   and   the   constraints   to be   used   in   the   linear   programming   model to determine the optimum   usage   of the   remaining   resources to maximise the company’s profits   for   July.      (6 marks)
(d)          The optimal solution   has   been   determined   as:

R                                                                           500 units
S                                                                           0 units
T                                                                           880 units


Explain which of the constraints you stated   in   (c)   are   binding   on   the   solution.
(You are not   required to   draw a   graph.)          (4 marks)
(e)          Critically evaluate the   benefits   and   limitations   of   using   linear   programming for      planning purposes.      (10 marks)
(Total 40 marks)
